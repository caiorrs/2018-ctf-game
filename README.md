The problem is, information security can&#39;t figure out what was transmitted. We need your help!<br/><br/>*Here&#39;s some information that will help you during the investigation.* Due to employee outrage at SSL break/inspect, our information security department decided to &quot;patch&quot; the kernel and seed random values with timestamps so that users don&#39;t complain about HTTPS warnings when they browse the web and they can still decrypt all the traffic. It&#39;s genius! The suspect was obsessed with snakes, and we don&#39;t have any Python experts on our team, can you take a look?</td>
